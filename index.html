    <p>As digital marketing continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, companies must remain agile in their outreach strategies. In the past, traditional media like television and newspapers were dominant, but today’s brands __11__ digital platforms such as social media, influencer collaborations, and targeted content marketing. This shift not only allows businesses to reach global audiences instantly, but also to __12__ campaigns in real-time based on data analytics.

However, with greater speed and exposure comes greater risk: missteps or insensitive messaging can __13__ backlash within minutes, forcing public relations teams into overdrive. To mitigate such risks, companies are investing heavily in AI tools that can __14__ potential controversies before content goes live. __15__ these developments, marketing experts emphasize the importance of staying authentic, as modern consumers are increasingly savvy and distrustful of overt manipulation.</p>

    <p>The field of urban planning has grown increasingly complex as cities face mounting challenges from climate change, population growth, and technological disruption. Planners today must __16__ not only the physical layout of a city but also its environmental impact and social inclusivity. For instance, smart city projects integrate sensors and data analysis to manage traffic flow, reduce energy use, and __17__ emergency response systems. Meanwhile, efforts to create more equitable spaces have led to the development of “15-minute cities,” where residents can access essential services within a short walk or bike ride. Despite these innovations, critics argue that such models sometimes __18__ lower-income communities if affordability is not considered. Furthermore, balancing historic preservation with new development has proven difficult, especially when older neighborhoods risk being __19__ by luxury condos and commercial complexes. In addressing these multifaceted issues, urban planners are encouraged to __20__ both interdisciplinary collaboration and active community engagement to build cities that serve all their residents.</p>

    <p>Water makes up more than half of our body weight. To sustain this amount of fluid in our bodies, plain water is considered our best choice, for it contains no sugar and no calories. Yet, is water always the healthiest drink we can __21__? Well, it depends on who and where we are, and what we’re doing.</p>
    <p>Obviously, a physically __22__ person with an outdoor job under the sun will need to drink more fluid than a desk-bound person who lives and works in an air-conditioned place. But there’s more to it than that. When a person sweats, he loses water and salt, so he needs to replace both. Replacing lost fluid with just plain water means the body has too much water and not enough salt. To __23__ things out, the body will get rid of water by producing urine.</p>
    <p>For this reason, milk can actually be more __24__ than drinking water. Milk naturally contains salt and lactose, a sugar which the human body needs in small amounts to help stimulate water __25__. Coconut water, which contains salt and carbohydrates, is also more functional than water at restoring and maintaining a normal fluid __26__ after exercise.</p>
    <p>For the average person, however, water remains a very good __27__ for keeping hydrated—if you know how to drink it. The secret is: Never wait until the body is telling you you’re thirsty, since there must already have been significant changes in your body for it to eventually __28__ your consciousness. At that point, it might be well past the best moment to take in fluid. Also, drinking a lot of liquid in one go can cause more water to __29__ the body quickly and come out as urine. To __30__ this, you need to drink water throughout the day to maintain your hydration levels.</p>

    <p>Urban greening, the practice of incorporating plants into city environments, is becoming increasingly vital. With more than half of the world's population living in urban areas, the need for green spaces has never been greater. __31__ Besides beautifying neighborhoods, greenery improves air quality, lowers urban temperatures, and promotes mental health.</p>
    
    <p>Historically, green spaces were often viewed as luxury features, reserved for wealthy neighborhoods or tourist attractions. __32__ Today, city planners recognize that equitable access to parks and trees is essential for public well-being and environmental resilience.</p>
    
    <p>The benefits of urban greening extend beyond aesthetics. __33__ Plants absorb carbon dioxide, filter pollutants, and provide habitat for urban wildlife. Moreover, community gardens and rooftop farms can enhance food security in densely populated areas.</p>
    
    <p>__34__ As cities continue to grow, integrating nature into urban planning offers a hopeful path forward. Rather than fighting against nature, future cities might thrive by growing alongside it.</p>

  <!-- Passage 1 -->
  <div class="reading-passage">
  <h3>Passage 1: </h3>
  <p>Once associated only with the wild plains of North America, coyotes have now adapted to life in bustling cities. Studies conducted in Chicago and Los Angeles reveal that these adaptable canines navigate traffic, avoid human interactions, and even utilize train tracks and drainage systems to move safely. Equipped with remarkable night vision and a keen sense of smell, urban coyotes are reshaping our understanding of wildlife boundaries.</p>

  <p>Researchers fitted several coyotes with GPS collars, discovering that these animals establish "ghost territories"—areas where they are almost never seen despite their constant presence. Unlike rural coyotes, urban ones tend to hunt alone, surviving on a diet of rodents, fruit, and human garbage. Interestingly, they play a significant ecological role by controlling pest populations, leading some biologists to argue for their protection rather than removal.</p>

  <p>Urban coyotes have become more resourceful in their quest for survival. They frequently use alleyways, hidden underpasses, and even rooftops to stay out of sight from humans. Their ability to adapt to the concrete jungle has raised questions about how wildlife, in general, can thrive in urban spaces. Some researchers even suggest that coyotes may be an indication of how other species could learn to coexist in cities. In fact, their presence in urban ecosystems may be beneficial to biodiversity by contributing to the balance of predator-prey relationships.</p>

  <p>However, not everyone embraces these new neighbors. Incidents of coyotes attacking pets have sparked heated debates about coexistence. Wildlife experts emphasize that feeding coyotes or leaving food outside increases the likelihood of conflict. Public education campaigns now aim to teach city dwellers how to minimize risks while allowing these resilient creatures to thrive within urban ecosystems. On the other hand, some argue that culling or removing coyotes is the only way to prevent future confrontations between wildlife and humans.</p>

  <p>There are also challenges related to coyotes' interactions with domestic animals. In particular, small dogs and cats are at risk of being attacked if left unattended. Some cities have started initiatives to encourage pet owners to be more vigilant and keep their pets indoors during certain times of day or night, particularly at dusk or dawn when coyotes are most active. Public parks are another site of concern, where human presence often intersects with coyotes' hunting areas.</p>

  <p>Despite these concerns, urban coyotes continue to thrive in cities across North America, from New York City to San Francisco. Their ability to adapt to human-dominated environments has made them a symbol of resilience in the face of adversity. This adaptability might be the key to their long-term survival in a world where wild spaces are increasingly limited. By understanding their behavior and promoting coexistence strategies, people may find that they can share urban spaces with these remarkable creatures.</p>

  <h3>Passage 2</h3>
  <p>With the global population projected to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050, food security has become a growing concern. One innovative solution gaining momentum is vertical farming—growing crops in stacked layers within controlled indoor environments. Utilizing hydroponic systems, LED lighting, and precise climate control, vertical farms can produce vegetables year-round without pesticides or soil. These advancements not only promise to enhance food security but also offer a solution to urban spaces that struggle to accommodate traditional farming methods.</p>

  <p>Vertical farms can be built in urban areas, taking advantage of empty buildings and rooftops, reducing the need for agricultural land and long-distance transportation of produce. This method also allows for higher crop density, making it possible to grow more food in less space. The efficiency of vertical farming is demonstrated by companies like AeroFarms and Plenty, which have shown that vertical farms can yield up to 390 times more produce per square meter compared to traditional farming. This method can also cut down the carbon footprint of food production by eliminating the need for transportation and land clearance.</p>

  <p>Additionally, vertical farming drastically reduces water usage by recycling it within the system. In traditional farming, vast amounts of water are used to irrigate crops, but vertical farms use hydroponic systems that allow water to be recirculated, minimizing waste. As water scarcity becomes an increasing issue in many parts of the world, this technology offers a sustainable alternative. However, critics point out the high energy demands required to maintain artificial light and temperature conditions, making the long-term sustainability of these farms a subject of ongoing debate.</p>

  <p>Governments and investors are showing increased interest. Singapore, for example, has incorporated vertical farms into its food security strategy to reduce reliance on imports. The city-state’s limited land availability makes vertical farming an ideal solution to meet local food demands. Meanwhile, researchers are working on improving energy efficiency and developing solar-powered systems to further enhance the viability of vertical agriculture worldwide. Solar-powered vertical farms could significantly reduce the environmental impact of this farming method by tapping into renewable energy sources, which would make vertical farming a more sustainable option for the future.</p>

  <p>As vertical farming technology advances, more and more cities are beginning to adopt it as part of their strategy for creating sustainable urban food systems. The potential for year-round production of high-quality crops, along with the ability to grow food in locations where traditional farming is not feasible, could transform the way the world approaches agriculture. With continued innovation and investment, vertical farming could become an essential part of ensuring global food security in the coming decades.</p>

  <h3>Passage 3</h3>
  <p>In 1901, divers exploring a Roman-era shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera discovered a corroded, gear-filled object that would later astonish historians and scientists alike. The Antikythera Mechanism, dating back to around 100 BCE, is now recognized as the world's oldest known analog computer, designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance. The device, consisting of a series of intricate gears and dials, was likely used by ancient Greeks to track celestial events, showing a deep understanding of the cosmos.</p>

  <p>Detailed X-ray scans revealed a complex assembly of at least 30 bronze gears housed within a wooden casing. Researchers believe the device could model the irregular motion of the Moon, track the movements of the five known planets, and even account for leap years. Such precision suggests a far greater level of technological sophistication in ancient Greece than previously assumed. The mechanism's ability to calculate such detailed astronomical events demonstrates the Greeks' advanced understanding of mathematics and engineering, which was far ahead of their time.</p>

  <p>Despite decades of study, many mysteries remain. No written records directly describe the construction or use of the mechanism. Some scholars theorize it was part of a broader tradition of mechanical craftsmanship that has otherwise been lost. The device's function, though partially understood, still holds many secrets, such as how exactly it was operated or how widespread the knowledge of such technology was in ancient Greece. Today, scientists continue to create working replicas of the device, hoping to uncover more secrets about humanity's early pursuit of scientific understanding. These replicas help researchers test theories and refine their understanding of ancient technologies.</p>

  <p>Some believe the Antikythera Mechanism was part of a much larger tradition of mechanical devices that were used for astronomical and timekeeping purposes. While no other examples of such technology have been found, the discovery of this artifact continues to fuel debates about what other advancements may have been lost to history. As scientists continue to study it, the Antikythera Mechanism stands as a testament to the ingenuity of ancient Greek craftsmanship and their ability to innovate long before the modern technological age.</p>
